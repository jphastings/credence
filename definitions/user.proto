// A statement that there is a public/private key pair that a person is using
// with Credence.
// - The public key in question is stated outright.
// - The person claiming to own the associated private key can be identified
//   by the identity_uri (and possibly the name).
// - The proof_uri might be a link to a post on twitter by the user saying "I am
//   a Credence User with fingerprint 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff" allowing
//   other users to make a judgement call as to whether that is the person they
//   are expecting.
// - Any user can sign the assertion that this public key is associated to this identity.
//   - When self-signing, the fingerprint should be the fingerprint of the given
//     public key, and the associated private key used to make the signature.
//   - When counter-signing, the fingerprint should be of the counter-signing user
//     and the signature created using their private key.
